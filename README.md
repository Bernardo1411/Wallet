# About the project

#### Link: https://mywallet.surge.sh/

MyWallet is an application that calculates expenses and then converts the actual amount of the expense to its value in reais (BRL). It is ideal for those who live in Brazil and need to make purchases in one of the listed currencies. In addition to converting the expense, the application will save the expense data in a list and calculate the totality of all expenses. It also provides two graphs. One of the graphs shows the evolution of total expenses. The second graph provides the total expenditure by category (tag). In case the user makes a mistake, he can edit that specific expense or delete it.

In this application, the user does not need to create a user, because there is no backend. To acess the wallet page, just insert a valid email (can be a fake one) and insert any password with six characters or more.
